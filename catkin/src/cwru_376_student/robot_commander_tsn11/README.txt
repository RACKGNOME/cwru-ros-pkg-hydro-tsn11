This folder contains the Theodore Nowak's code for the vel_scheduler with implemented estop, lidar_alarm, and soft_stop.

The vel_scheduler file can be run by calling "rosrun robot_commander_tsn11 vel_scheduler_tsn11"

In order to call the other cpp files in the folder similarly one would call "rosrun robot_commander_tsn11 CPPFILENAME_tsn11"

This code is intended to be used for Project 3 of EECS 376 with Wyatt Newman.
